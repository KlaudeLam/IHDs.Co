              goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the
              world and the importance of their recognition in public policy
              objectives. It also recognized the need for a more inclusive,
              equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes
              sustainable development, poverty eradication, happiness and the
              well-being of all peoples.

              the value of national happiness over national income since the
              early 1970s and famously adopted the goal of Gross National
              Happiness over Gross National Product. It also hosted a High Level
              Meeting on "Happiness and Well-Being: Defining a New Economic
              Paradigm" during the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.

              <strong>It’s a day to be happy, of course!</strong> Since 2013,
              the United Nations has celebrated the International Day of
              Happiness as a way to recognise the importance of happiness in the
              lives of people around the world.

              Happiness is a fundamental human goal. The United Nations General
              Assembly recognizes this goal and calls for “a more inclusive,
              equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes
              the happiness and well-being of all peoples.”

              There is a wide variety of activities that anyone can participate
              on this occassion. A family trip, a hangout with your friend
              circle, a date with your beloved, or even a walk with your pet! As
              long as you feel the happiness when spending quality time, you can
              do anything you want to the way you like.

          <div class="description left">
            As we grow older, we tend to forget how life could be so delightful
            and instead focus on the stress from work and from ourselves. At
            some point, you may find it lonely to go through the day even when
            being together with other people, but it is totally normal to feel
            that way since these feelings are totally natural and inevitable.
            The only thing that we can do is to face it directly, with a
            positive mindset and every thing will be alright! Treasure every
            moments, live your life to the fullest, and reward yourself with the
            peace of mind it deserve. You deserve it.
